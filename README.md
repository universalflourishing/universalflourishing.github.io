## About UFI

The Universal Flourishing Initiative (UFI) is founded on the recognition of the inherent dignity and potential within every human being. We believe a better, more equitable world is not just possible, but necessary â€“ one where everyone has the opportunity and the resources to truly thrive. Our aim is to articulate, inspire, and connect efforts towards creating the conditions for universal flourishing.
